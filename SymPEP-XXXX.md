## Abstract

This SymPEP proposes the adoption of static typing in the SymPy codebase. Static typing can enhance the development experience, improve code quality, and facilitate better collaboration among contributors.

## Motivation and Scope

The current SymPy codebase is predominantly dynamically typed, which can lead to runtime errors and make it harder to understand the codebase. The adoption of static typing will provide better tooling support, catch type-related errors at compile-time, and improve the overall robustness of the library. This SymPEP aims to define the scope and guidelines for introducing static typing to SymPy.

## Usage and Impact

With static typing, users of SymPy will benefit from improved code suggestions, better error messages, and increased confidence in the correctness of their code. For instance, when working with symbolic expressions, the static type system can help catch potential issues in function calls, attribute accesses, and type mismatches. This will lead to a more intuitive and reliable programming experience for SymPy users.

For example, the functions can be static typed as follows:

```python
from typing import List
from sympy import Expr, Symbol

def differentiate(expr: Expr, var: Symbol) -> Expr:
    """
    Differentiate a SymPy expression with respect to a variable.
    """
    return expr.diff(var)

def simplify_expressions(expressions: List[Expr]) -> List[Expr]:
    """
    Simplify a list of SymPy expressions.
    """
    return [expr.simplify() for expr in expressions]
```

which is better than the dynamically typed versions:

```python
def differentiate(expr, var):
    """
    Differentiate a SymPy expression with respect to a variable.
    """
    return expr.diff(var)

def simplify_expressions(expressions):
    """
    Simplify a list of SymPy expressions.
    """
    return [expr.simplify() for expr in expressions]
```

which is not friendly for users because they can simplify expressions with a list of integers or strings. The static typed version can catch this error at compile-time.


```python
from sympy import Expr, Symbol

def differentiate(expr, var):
    """
    Differentiate a SymPy expression with respect to a variable.
    """
    if isinstance(expr, Expr) and isinstance(var, Symbol):
        return expr.diff(var)
    else:
        raise TypeError("expr must be a SymPy expression and var must be a SymPy symbol")

def simplify_expressions(expressions):
    """
    Simplify a list of SymPy expressions.
    """
    if isinstance(expressions, list):
        if all(isinstance(expr, Expr) for expr in expressions):
            return [expr.simplify() for expr in expressions]
    else:
        raise TypeError("expressions must be a list of SymPy expressions")
```

which is more verbose and less efficient than the static typed versions, because of added runtime type checks.

## Backwards Compatibility

Introducing static typing to SymPy may break backwards compatibility for code that relies on dynamically typed behavior. Users who heavily depend on runtime type inference might need to update their code to match the new type annotations.

## Detailed Description

This SymPEP proposes the gradual introduction of static type annotations using tools like Python's typing module and third-party type checkers such as ``mypy`` or ``pyright``. The process will involve identifying critical modules, functions, and classes to initiate the integration of static typing. Guidelines will be established for annotating function signatures, class attributes, and return types. The objective is to maintain compatibility with existing dynamically typed code while facilitating a seamless transition.

Authors of new classes, functions, or modules in SymPy should be encouraged to write their code with static typing, unless they encounter a situation where achieving this is difficult or not possible. Even in such cases, the authors should be prompted to provide type stubs for their code, allowing for users to benefit from static typing.

It's important to note that tools like ``mypy`` and ``pyright`` are capable of inferring types, which simplifies the process of incorporating static typing without requiring a steep learning curve. By adding a few annotations, the code can be enhanced in terms of clarity, facilitating the transition to static typing across the entire codebase.

Encouraging the SymPy community to collaborate on creating ``.pyi`` files to provide type stubs for all exported functions and classes in SymPy is recommended for fostering public access to type information.

Although the core CPython is inherently dynamically typed, nearly all core CPython standard libraries are equipped with type annotations. Similarly, popular third-party libraries like ``numpy``, ``scipy``, or ``pandas`` provide users with type annotations.

SymPy holds a pivotal role as a library used by many other libraries and stands at the forefront of the supply chain of scientific computing libraries. However, it currently lags behind technical standards by lacking comprehensive type annotations.

The following forms of typing are permissible to be added to the sympy code base:

For functions, classes, and modules internally used by SymPy that currently include unnecessary dynamic type checks, advocating for a shift towards static typing is advisable. This transition can help eliminate these redundant checks and consequently enhance the overall performance of the SymPy codebase.

Similarly, functions, classes, and modules within SymPy that intentionally avoided runtime type checks for performance reasons should consider embracing static typing. Static typing undoubtedly mitigates performance overhead while providing better bug detection capabilities related to type errors.

## Implementation

1. Identify key modules for static typing.
2. Start by adding type annotations to function signatures and class attributes.
3. Use `mypy` or `pyright` to perform static type checking and address any issues.
4. Gradually propagate static typing to dependent modules and functions.
5. Update documentation to reflect the new static typing conventions.
6. Use `mypy` or `pyright` with strict mode.

## Alternatives

An alternative approach would be to maintain the status quo of dynamic typing. However, this could lead to ongoing challenges in maintaining code quality and preventing runtime errors, especially as the SymPy codebase continues to evolve.
